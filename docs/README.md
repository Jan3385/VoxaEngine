> During the making of this engine I have decited to call the squares that are used in the celluar automata and the main driving point of this engine `voxels`. I am aware that these squares do *not* fall into that definition since voxel is a shorthand for volumetric pixel. I am missing an extra dimension for the *voxels* to be volumetric. I havent found any other good definition for the squares in the engine as pixel doesnt entirely fit that definition too and I am just not calling them squares everywhere. So anytime you see the word "voxel" just pretend with me that it can and does mean a 2D square *or* 3D cube.
